## Start:
```
Create react application: npx create-react-app 01basic
-> It's take more time, and also it is a bulky utility
-> If script not run, [module not find] then install: npm install --save-dev ajv@^7
```
Note: Some file are not needed in src. In 01_basic, there are only- App.js, index.js

## Start with vite:
```
Create react app using: npm create vite@latest
-> Project name:
-> Select framework: React
-> Select varient: JavaScript
After this,
npm install to install dependencies, because there is no node_modulus and some other dependencies
-> npm run dev
```

We faces some error in both projects, and the solution is simple: function name(first ch) must be capitalize and, it is good to capitalize component first ch
