## Why to learn react.js?
    Make easy to manage build complex frontend

## Why should I learn react?
    After mastering Js
    For need of complex structure.

## React is a librar

## Topics to learn
    core of React (State OR UI manipulation, JSX)
    Component Reusability
    Reusing of component (Props)
    How to propagate change (hooks)

## Additional Addons to React
```
Router (React don't have Router)
State management (React don't have state management)
    â†’ Redux, Redux toolkit, zustand, context API
Class based component
    â†’ Legacy code ðŸ’€
BAAS Apps
    â†’ Social media clone, e-commerce App...
```



## Start:
```
Create react application: npx create-react-app 01basic
-> It's take more time, and also it is a bulky utility
-> If script not run [module not find], then install: npm install --save-dev ajv@^7
```
Note: Some file are not needed in src. In 01_basic, there are only- App.js, index.js

## Start with vite: (best way)
```
Create react app using: npm create vite@latest
-> Project name:
-> Select framework: React
-> Select varient: JavaScript
After this,
npm install to install dependencies, because there is no node_modulus and some other dependencies
-> npm run dev
```

We faces some error in both projects.And the solution is simple: function name(first ch) must be capitalize and, it is good to capitalize component's first char
